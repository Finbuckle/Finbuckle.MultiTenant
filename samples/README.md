# Samples

This folder contains simple examples of Finbuckle.MultiTenant and related packages in action.

Samples are grouped by Finbuckle.MultiTenant version and .NET version.

## Where are the samples?

Samples may not always be present in the main branch as they need to be updated to support later .NET versions. 
Contributions providing simple, up-to-date samples are always appreciated!
