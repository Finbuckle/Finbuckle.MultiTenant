## About Finbuckle.MultiTenant

Finbuckle.MultiTenant is an open-source multitenancy middleware library for .NET. It enables tenant resolution,
per-tenant app behavior, and per-tenant data isolation.
See [https://www.finbuckle.com/multitenant](https://www.finbuckle.com/multitenant) for more details and documentation.

### Bug Fixes

* only throw exception in EnforceMultiTenant for null tenant if there are entity changes. ([#819](https://github.com/Finbuckle/Finbuckle.MultiTenant/issues/819)) ([ca9e9fd](https://github.com/Finbuckle/Finbuckle.MultiTenant/commit/ca9e9fd9a55789d790d31f82756e5ecdac03a28f))
<!--_release-notes-->

## Quick Start

Finbuckle.MultiTenant is designed to be easy to use and follows standard .NET conventions as much as possible. This
introduction assumes a standard ASP.NET Core use case, but any application using .NET dependency injection can work with
the library.

### Installation

First, install the Finbuckle.MultiTenant.AspNetCore NuGet package:

.NET Core CLI

```bash
$ dotnet add package Finbuckle.MultiTenant.AspNetCore
```

### Basic Configuration

Next, in the app's service configuration call `AddMultiTenant<TTenantInfo>` and its various builder methods and in the
middleware configuration call `UseMultiTenant()`:

```cs
builder.Services.AddMultiTenant<TenantInfo>()
    .WithHostStrategy()
    .WithConfigurationStore();

// other app code...

app.UseMultiTenant();

// other app code...

app.Run();
```

That's all that is needed to get going. Let's breakdown each line:

`builder.Services.AddMultiTenant<TenantInfo>()`

This line registers the base services and designates `TenantInfo` as the class that will hold tenant information at
runtime.

The type parameter for `AddMultiTenant<TTenantInfo>` must be an implementation of `ITenantInfo` which holds basic
information about the tenant such as its name and an identifier. `TenantInfo` is provided as a basic implementation, but
a custom implementation can be used if more properties are needed.

See [Core Concepts](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/CoreConcepts) for more information on `ITenantInfo`.

`.WithHostStrategy()`

The line tells the app that our "strategy" to determine the request tenant will be to look at the request host, which
defaults to the extracting the subdomain as a tenant identifier.

See [MultiTenant Strategies](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/Strategies) for more information.

`.WithConfigurationStore()`

This line tells the app that information for all tenants are in the `appsettings.json` file used for app configuration.
If a tenant in the store has the identifier found by the strategy, the tenant will be successfully resolved for the
current request.

See [MultiTenant Stores](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/Stores) for more information.

Finbuckle.MultiTenant comes with a collection of strategies and store types that can be mixed and matched in various
ways.

`app.UseMultiTenant()`

This line configures the middleware which resolves the tenant using the registered strategies, stores, and other
settings. Be sure to call it before other middleware which will use per-tenant functionality,
e.g. `UseAuthentication()`.

### Basic Usage

With the services and middleware configured, access information for the current tenant from the `TenantInfo` property on
the `MultiTenantContext<T>` object accessed from the `GetMultiTenantContext<T>` extension method:

```cs
var tenantInfo = HttpContext.GetMultiTenantContext<TenantInfo>().TenantInfo;

if(tenantInfo != null)
{
    var tenantId = tenantInfo.Id;
    var identifier = tenantInfo.Identifier;
    var name = tenantInfo.Name;
}
```

The type of the `TenantInfo` property depends on the type passed when calling `AddMultiTenant<T>` during configuration.
If the current tenant could not be determined then `TenantInfo` will be null.

The `ITenantInfo` instance and/or the typed instance are also available directly through dependency injection.

See [Configuration and Usage](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/ConfigurationAndUsage) for more information.

## Documentation

The library builds on this basic functionality to provide a variety of higher level features. See
the [documentation](https://www.finbuckle.com/multitenant/docs) for
more details:

* [Per-tenant Options](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/Options)
* [Per-tenant Authentication](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/Authentication)
* [Entity Framework Core Data Isolation](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/EFCore)
* [ASP.NET Core Identity Data Isolation](https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/Identity)
