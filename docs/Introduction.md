## About Finbuckle.MultiTenant

Finbuckle.MultiTenant is open source multitenancy middleware library for .NET. It enables tenant resolution, per-tenant
app behavior, and per-tenant data isolation.
See [https://www.finbuckle.com/multitenant](https://www.finbuckle.com/multi-tenant) for more details and documentation.

**This release supports .NET 8, .NET 7, and .NET 6.**

Beginning with Finbuckle.MultiTenant 8.0.0 major version releases align with .NET major version releases and target all
Microsoft supported major .NET versions at the time of initial release.

New development focuses on the latest Finbuckle.MultiTenant release version while critical security and severe bug 
fixes will be released for prior versions which target .NET versions supported by Microsoft.

In general, you should target the version of Finbuckle.MultiTenant that matches your .NET version.
