# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome.

New, updated, and improved samples, docs, and tests are always needed.

For small changes and corrections please go ahead and open a pull request.

For more complex changes or new features please file an issue before you open a pull request so we can discuss and plan
accordingly.

Regarding new features, the repository prioritizes maintainability, core functionality, and common use-cases.
Additional features will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Authors are encouraged to host their own repositories for functionality outside these guidelines and to submit a pull
request adding an appropriate section, description, and link to their repository in to the official docs.
